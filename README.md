hi everyone,

This repository comprises two code pieces. Part 1 of the bi project is an LSTM model that forecasts ECG signals from the MITBH arrythmia dataset. Part 2 (try3.py) comprises the code for streamlit, which is intended for user input and displays the anticipated signals from Part 1.
Finally, I constructed a website that would display the projected plot utilizing streamlit cloud.
